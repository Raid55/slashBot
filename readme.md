This is a bot called backslash.

its still being made so nothing is finished and I am also learning and trying out new things so things might not be at their best but ill get to it when I can... for now..MLP

you use a backslash to talk to the bot, it uses NLP to extract an intent and entities instead of typing in a regular command.
